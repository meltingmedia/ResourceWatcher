## ResourceWatcher

ResourceWatcher is MODX Revolution plugin that let you send emails upon resource update
and/or creation.

## Configuration

Either install from the package manager or run the build script.
Configure the plugin behavior in the system settings (resourcewatcher namespace).

## Support

Would you like to support?
Since my mother language isn't English, i might (more than probably) have written
ugly English. Feel free to provide a better one.
Also, if you speak another language, do not hesitate to provide a translation.

Can you write better code?
Go on, fork, commit, pull request (comments on what i've done badly are also
welcomeâ€¦ help me become a better dev!).
